PHP 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 Examples
=============================

This repository contains various examples of some of the "new" features in PHP 5.3,
PHP 5.4 and PHP 5.5. It also contains some experiments that I ended up abandoning
for one reason or another. This is by no means production ready code. It was built
to show quick and easy to digest examples for a PHP meetup group. If you put it in your
web root or start the PHP built-in web server, you should see a menu with the various
code examples and running examples.

php -S 127.0.0.1:8000

Then browse to http://localhost:8000

If there's another feature you'd like to see examples for, please open an issue
or send a pull request.
